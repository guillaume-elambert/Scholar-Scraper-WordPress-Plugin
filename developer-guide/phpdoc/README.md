# PHPDoc

Here are listed the classes of the plugin. \
All the classes are regrouped in the `Model\` namespace.

!> For the moment I haven't found a way to generate the PHPDoc for the methods and properties,
so their documentation has not been added to the following PHPDoc but can be found in the source code.

!> **<u>Note :</u>** I am French, so I wrote the PHPDoc in French and I apologize for this inconvenience. \
I may translate it into English in the future, but it is not a priority at the moment.
Therefore, please use the great tool [Google Translate][google-translate] to translate the PHPDoc.
